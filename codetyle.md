# The backend code refers to the Alibaba JavaScript Style Guide.
### Modular Structure
The backend code is organized into separate modules, such as routes (contacts.js), controllers (contactsController.js), and database configuration (db.js). This modular architecture improves code readability and simplifies maintenance, as it follows the "separation of concerns" principle.
### RESTful API Design
The backend implements RESTful API design principles by using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to handle CRUD operations. This results in a standardized and intuitive API interface, making it easier for the frontend to consume and interact with the backend.
### Use of Express Framework
Express.js is utilized as the core framework for the backend server, providing middleware, routing, and request handling capabilities. This use of Express simplifies the setup of server functionality and ensures efficient processing of incoming requests.
### Database Interaction
The code uses the mysql2 library for direct interaction with a MySQL database, utilizing raw SQL queries. This straightforward approach ensures efficiency, and the use of parameterized queries effectively mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing security.
### Error Handling and Data Validation
Error handling within the controllers ensures that any issues during database interactions are appropriately caught and resolved, with relevant HTTP status codes returned. Basic validation for critical data fields, such as name and phone, is performed to maintain data consistency and accuracy.
### JSDoc-Style Comments
The code includes detailed JSDoc-style comments to describe the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions. This level of documentation improves overall code comprehension and simplifies future maintenance.
### Security Focus
Security is a priority in the backend implementation, with parameterized SQL queries (db.query(query, [params], callback)) employed to prevent SQL injection attacks. This approach significantly enhances the application's defense against common security vulnerabilities.
### Effective Middleware Usage
In the server setup, middleware is effectively utilized for various purposes. The cors middleware is used to manage cross-origin requests, allowing secure interactions between the frontend and backend. Additionally, express.json() middleware is employed for parsing incoming JSON data, resulting in effective request management.
